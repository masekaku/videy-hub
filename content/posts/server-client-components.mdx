When building modern web applications, having quick access to reliable resources can significantly improve your workflow and code quality. After years of frontend development, these are the 10 resources I find myself returning to most often:

• **[https://videy.co/v/?id=e0614f72](https://videy.co/v/?id=e0614f72)**
• **[https://videy.co/v/?id=mweI6f741](https://videy.co/v/?id=mweI6f741)**
• **[https://videy.co/v/?id=y9TiSVlp1](https://videy.co/v/?id=y9TiSVlp1)**
4. **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - Essential for version control, collaboration, and discovering open-source projects.
5. **[CodePen](https://codepen.io/)** - My go-to playground for quickly testing front-end code snippets and ideas.
6. **[Dev.to](https://dev.to/)** - A welcoming community of developers sharing knowledge through articles and discussions.
7. **[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)** - In-depth articles on web design and development best practices.
8. **[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)** - High-quality video courses on modern JavaScript frameworks and tools.
